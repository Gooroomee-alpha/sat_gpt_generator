https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suprematism,"Suprematism, an art movement founded by Kazimir Malevich in 1913, revolutionized the aesthetic framework with its focus on basic geometric shapes and a limited color palette. It emphasized the ""supremacy of pure artistic feeling"" over the representation of objects. Malevich's iconic works, such as ""Black Square"" and ""White on White,"" epitomized this philosophy, marking a significant shift towards non-objectivity in art. Despite the movement's anti-materialist stance, which contrasted sharply with the utilitarian Constructivism, Suprematism had a profound impact on the development of modern art, influencing architecture and design. However, the rise of Stalinism and the imposition of Socialist Realism stifled its progress, relegating Suprematism to a historical avant-garde movement."
