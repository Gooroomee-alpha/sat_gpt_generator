The debt crisis peaked when Mexico announced its inability to service its $80 billion debt in 1982, leading to a cascade of similar declarations from other nations. The US Federal Reserve, alongside international institutions, orchestrated a response that included restructuring debt and implementing economic reforms in debtor nations.

https://wcfia.harvard.edu/publications/why-nations-fail-origins-power-prosperity-and-poverty,"Daron Acemoglu and James Robinson argue that the disparity in prosperity among nations is due to the political and economic institutions that shape societies. They cite the stark contrast between North and South Korea as evidence that inclusive institutions—those that provide incentives for investment, innovation, and economic participation—lead to wealth, while extractive institutions lead to poverty and repression. Their research spans across historical examples from the Roman Empire to modern states, building a theory of political economy that addresses why nations fail or succeed."

Akerlof's 1970 paper ""The Market for 'Lemons'"" revolutionized economic thought by addressing quality uncertainty and its impact on markets. Akerlof, a future Nobel laureate, demonstrated how asymmetric information can lead to market failure, particularly in used car markets where sellers often know more than buyers. This imbalance can result in adverse selection, driving good quality cars out of the market and leaving only 'lemons'. Akerlof's work challenged traditional economic models that assumed perfect information and laid the groundwork for a new branch of economic theory.

The paper also highlights the faster NFA adjustment in emerging markets compared to advanced economies, and the unique position of reserve-currency countries in terms of adjustment speed and as insurance against income shocks."
