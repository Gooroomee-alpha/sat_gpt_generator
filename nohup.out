Some weights of RobertaModel were not initialized from the model checkpoint at roberta-base and are newly initialized: ['roberta.pooler.dense.weight', 'roberta.pooler.dense.bias']
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.

passage="Katsushika Hokusai's iconic woodblock print, 'The Great Wave off Kanagawa,' created in late 1831, is renowned for its dynamic composition and use of Prussian blue. It depicts a towering wave threatening boats near Mount Fuji. As the first print in Hokusai's series 'Thirty-six Views of Mount Fuji,' it revolutionized Japanese printmaking through its blend of traditional Japanese art and European graphical perspective. This piece not only achieved immediate success in Japan but also profoundly influenced European Impressionists. The print's enduring legacy is evident in its presence in numerous museums worldwide and its status as one of the most reproduced images in art history." problem_type='blank'
