Some weights of RobertaModel were not initialized from the model checkpoint at roberta-base and are newly initialized: ['roberta.pooler.dense.weight', 'roberta.pooler.dense.bias']
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.

{"passage": "In their 2008 study, Nikiforakis and Normann conducted a comparative-statics analysis of punishment in public-good experiments, examining how varying the effectiveness of punishment impacts cooperation. Their findings revealed that as punishment effectiveness increased, contributions to the public good rose, leading to near-complete cooperation and welfare improvements. ______, when punishment effectiveness fell below a certain threshold, it failed to sustain cooperation, and the availability of punishment actually reduced overall welfare. This research underscores the significance of the punishment factor in experimental outcomes and suggests that the level of punishment effectiveness is crucial for fostering cooperation in public goods scenarios.", "question": "Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition?", "choices": ["However", "Additionally", "Accordingly", "Besides"], "answer": "However"}
